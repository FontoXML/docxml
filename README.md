# DOCX Markup Language

This is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)/[Deno](https://deno.land) module for making `.docx` files from scratch or from
an existing DOCX/DOTX template.

You could use `docxml` to:

- Create an MS Word file without ever opening MS Word
- Create a parameterized template file, and render it to DOCX with your data parameters
- Convert JSON, XML or other data structures to DOCX
- Parse content from an existing DOCX file
- Extract style definitions from a DOTX/DOCX file

### For Deno or for NodeJS

`docxml` can be used in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Deno](https://deno.land) according to the traditions in those
ecosystems. For Node users, simply `npm install docxml` and then `require()` or `import` as you wish. For Deno users,
`import "deno.land/x/docxml/mod.ts"` or use an import map if you wish.

```js
// NodeJS using CommonJS:
const { default: Docxml, Paragraph } = require('docxml');

// NodeJS using ES6 modules, or Deno with an import map
import Docxml, { Paragraph } from 'docxml';

// Deno without an import map
import Docxml, { Paragraph } from 'https://deno.land/x/docxml/mod.ts';
```

[Read all about `docxml` in Deno or Node](./docs/setup/deno-or-node.md)

### For JSX or for vanilla

`docxml` is designed to be used in vanilla JavaScript using class component instances, or using JSX if you're on Deno or
want to use NodeJS and a transpiler like Babel:

```ts
const para = new Paragraph({ alignment: 'center' }, new Text({}, 'I want a cookie'));
```

```tsx
/** @jsx Docx.jsx */
const para = (
	<Paragraph alignment="center">
		<Text>I want a cookie</Text>
	</Paragraph>
);
```

### For XML or for anything

`docxml` is also designed to be used from scratch/entirely programmatically, or using a more ergonomic API
to transform from an XML document. Both modes work equally well with vanilla JS or JSX.

```tsx
await Docx.fromJsx(
	<Paragraph alignment="center">
		<Text>I want a cookie</Text>
	</Paragraph>,
).toFile('example-1.docx');
```

```tsx
await Docx.fromNothing()
	.withXmlRule('self::text()', ({ node }) => <Text>{node.nodeValue}</Text>)
	.withXmlRule('self::p', ({ traverse, node }) => (
		<Paragraph alignment={node.getAttribute('align')}>{traverse()}</Paragraph>
	))
	.withXml(`<p align="center">I want a cookie</p>`, {})
	.toFile('example-2.docx');
```

# Differences with actual MS Word DOCX

Obviously `docxml` is a TypeScript project, which is already very different from how you would normally interact
with a DOCX document. More meaningfully however, `docxml` is meant to make writing DOCX _easier_ than going straight
to OOXML. For example;

- All sizes are of type `Length`, which means it doesn't matter wether you input them as points, centimeters,
  inches, 1/2, 1/8th or 1/20th points, English Metric Units, and so on.
- The JSX pragma will try to correct components that would lead to invalid XML structures, by splitting the parents of
  invalidly placed components recursively until the new position is valid. Moreover, string content in unexpected places
  is automatically wrapped in `<Text>` when using JSX. This makes the configuration of a new DOCX a little more
  forgiving.
- Using the `<Image>` or `<Comment>` components will automatically create all required relationships etc.
- Some of the words have changed, generally speaking `docxml` is more verbose than the DOCX verbiage.
- Generally speaking `docxml` prefers formal (JS) references over references-by-identifier. In those cases the
  identifiers are randomly generated for you when the `.docx` file is written.
- Especially in tables and images, a lot of formatting details are automatically applied. In a lot of cases there
  is no API _yet_ to change them.
