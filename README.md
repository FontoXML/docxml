This is a [Deno](https://deno.land) module for making `.docx` files.

It can be used to create a `.docx` using components, for example:

```ts
/** @jsx Docx.JSX */
import Docx, { Paragraph } from 'https://deno.land/x/docxml/mod.ts';

Docx.fromJsx(<Paragraph>This is the simplest document you could make.</Paragraph>)
	.toArchive()
	.toFile('example-1.docx');
```

Or it can be used to convert any XML to DOCX:

```ts
/** @jsx Docx.JSX */
import Docx, { Paragraph, Text } from 'https://deno.land/x/docxml/mod.ts';

Docx.fromNothing()
	.withXmlRule('self::node()', ({ traverse }) => traverse('./*'))
	.withXmlRule('self::text()', ({ node }) => <Text>{node.nodeValue}</Text>)
	.withXmlRule('self::p', ({ traverse }) => <Paragraph>{traverse()}</Paragraph>)
	.withXmlRule('self::strong', ({ traverse }) => <Text isBold>{traverse()}</Text>)
	.fromXml(
		`<html>
			<body>
				<p>This is a very simply <strong>XML transformation</strong>.</p>
			</body>
		</html>`,
		{},
	)
	.toArchive()
	.toFile('example-2.docx');
```

# Formatting options

## Paragraph formatting

Paragraph styles may be applied via different ways;

```tsx
// As a prop:
<Paragraph alignment="center" />
```

```tsx
// As a style:
const style = api.styles.add({
	type: 'paragraph',
	paragraphProperties: {
		alignment: 'center',
	},
});
<Paragraph style={style} />;
```

- [See all the paragraph formatting options](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/x/docxml/src/properties/paragraph-properties.ts/~/ParagraphProperties).
- Every style property, and every property of every style property, is optional;


## Text formatting

```tsx
// As a prop:
<Text isBold />
```

- [See all the text formatting options](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/x/docxml/src/properties/text-properties.ts/~/TextProperties)
- Paragraph formatting options may be merged with text formatting options. When used directly on a component (ie. not via a style) the formatting only applies to the paragraph pilcrow ("Â¶") sign. In MS Word, the text styling options merged into a paragraph style definition _do_ apply to the paragraph text -- but may still be overriden with dedicated text formatting options.

```tsx
<Paragraph isBold>Text not shown as bold, but the paragraph's pilcrow is.</Paragraph>
```

```tsx
// As a style:
const style = api.styles.add({
	type: 'paragraph',
	textProperties: {
		isItalic: true,
	},
	paragraphProperties: {
		isBold: true,
	},
});
<Paragraph style={style}>Text is shown as bold and italic</Paragraph>;
```

# Differences with actual MS Word DOCX

Obviously `docxml` is a TypeScript project, which is already very different from how you would normally interact
with a DOCX document. More meaningfully however, `docxml` is meant to make writing DOCX _easier_. For example;

- All sizes are of type `Length`, which means it doesn't matter wether you input them as points, centimeters,
  inches, 1/2, 1/8th or 1/20th points, English Metric Units, and so on.
- The JSX pragma will try to correct components that would lead to invalid XML structures, by splitting the parents of
  invalidly placed components recursively until the new position is valid.
- Some of the words have changed, generally speaking `docxml` is more verbose than the DOCX verbiage.
- Generally speaking `docxml` prefers formal (JS) references over references-by-identifier. The identifiers are
  generated for you when the `.docx` file is written.
- Especially in tables and images, a lot of formatting details are automatically applied. In a lot of cases there
 is no API _yet_ to change them.
